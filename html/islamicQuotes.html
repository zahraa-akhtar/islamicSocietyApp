  				<p>Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) taught us to carry out good deeds, no matter how small they are.</p>
  				<p> In Islam, even a smile to a neighbour or removing a harmful object from the road, is classed as an act of charity. Abu Huraira (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: "A man passed by a fallen branch in the middle of the road and said, 'By Allah, I will remove this from the path of the Muslims so that it does not inconvenience them' and he was admitted into Paradise."</p>

  				<p>"Indeed, the righteous will be within gardens and springs. [Having been told], "Enter it in peace, safe [and secure]. And We will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment, [so they will be] brothers, on thrones facing each other. No fatigue will touch them therein, nor from it will they [ever] be removed." Qur'an 15:45-48</p>

  				<p>A man asked the Prophet "What sort of deeds are good?" The Prophet saw replied "To feed the poor and greet those whom you know and those whom you do not know"</p>

				<p>The prophet said "You will not enter paradise until you believe and you will not believe until you love one another. Shall I not tell you something that if you do it, you will love one another? Spread Salam amongst yourselves."</p>
